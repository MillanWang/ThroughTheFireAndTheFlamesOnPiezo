This code was written in June/July 2020 as a fun extracurricular exercise in the course SYSC3310 - Introduction to Embedded Programming
My professor thought that this was really cool and the video is now used as a demonstration for future students taking this course to show what is possible with the hardware

This was one of my favourite courses ever. Writing embedded code and then seeing it bring the hardware to life was super satisfying.
